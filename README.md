# Book_Store_Managment_System

This project creates a MySQL database system for a bookstore. The main table used is the books table, which stores important details about each book. To make the database better organized and reduce data repetition, a publishers table is also added.

The goal of this project is to convert raw book data into useful information that can help in business decisions. With SQL queries, we can answer important questions like:

Which books are in high demand or popular?

How does price affect availability?

Which book categories are most liked?

Do customer reviews affect price and availability?

How do different publishers impact the stock?

This project shows how to use SQL for retrieving data, analyzing it, using joins, applying conditions, updating and deleting records, and designing a proper database structure.
